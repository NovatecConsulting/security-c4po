    This tool allows a security tester to keep track of the testing progress after
    <a [href]="linkToWebsite"
       target="_blank">OWASP Testing Guide</a>.
    At this point, the Testing Guide materials are available as pdf which is a quite static resource. A tester needs to
    track progress, make comments and be in close contact with the client -- what a tedious task when having a pdf.
    Using a "webified" version of the testing guide would be more fun, right? The goal of this application is to make
    the great OWASP Testing Guide more actionable and more agile to work with.
    In the current version, only an outline is implemented to give an idea of what this tool is supposed to become.
